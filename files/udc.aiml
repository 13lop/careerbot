        This is the most popular choice for Computer Science students. As a software developer,
        you'll have the flexibility to work across various domains - from crafting web applications
        and mobile apps to developing enterprise software. Some developers choose to specialize in high-demand areas
        like game development, which requires graphics and physics knowledge, or embedded systems, where
        you'll work closer to the hardware level. The field offers both breadth and depth, allowing you
        to either become a versatile full-stack developer or specialize in your area of interest
        diving deep into their respective domains.

            Cybersecurity has evolved from a back-office IT function to a critical business priority, making it one of the 
            fastest-growing tech fields. As a cybersecurity analyst, you'll responsible for protecting organizations
            from increasingly sophisticated digital threats. The demand for cybersecurity specialists is projected to continue
            to grow over the next decade, especially in the public sector and the defense industry. Some cybersecurity specialties, 
            such as penetration testing, are highly dynamic and engaging, while others are more  relaxed and focused on keeping 
            organizations up to date on various security measures and incident response protocols.

            DevOps Engineering bridges the gap between software development and IT operations, making it a perfect role for those
            who enjoy both coding and system administration. As a DevOps engineer, you'll be responsible for streamlining 
            development processes, implementing continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and ensuring system 
            reliability. The role combines aspects of software development, system administration, and automation. Some DevOps roles
            involve on-call duties in which you are required to be available in case of an incident outside of the usual
            work hours, but this responsibility is usually spread in rotations among team members.

            Solutions Engineering combines technical expertise with business acumen, making it an excellent choice for those who
            enjoy both technology and client interaction. As a Solutions Engineer (also called Sales Engineer or Pre-Sales Engineer),
            you'll be the technical expert in the sales process, helping clients understand how your company's technology can solve 
            their business problems. The role offers a unique blend of software development, system architecture, and customer 
            engagement. What sets this role apart is the opportunity to work with diverse technologies while developing strong
            communication and presentation skills. Many find this role particularly rewarding as it can offer
            higher compensation than traditional development roles (through commission structures) while maintaining strong technical involvement.
